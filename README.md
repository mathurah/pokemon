# Pokeymon ðŸ”‘
* get it - because pokemon x key living? maybe I should stray away from puns and focus on building product  ðŸ˜…

## How it was made
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and used the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co). Didn't need to use any additional packages for this application.  

Thank you for the challenge - it was my first time using React - the new version using hooks. This was a great challenge to broaden my dev skills and it was fun to try out a new framework. 

## How to run the application ðŸ”¨
Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
`npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Please let me know if you have any questions and if there are any suggested improvements for the application! I'd love to learn what good code means to the team so I can grow as a dev ðŸ’»
